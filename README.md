# ComfyUI_Selectors
ComfyUI_Selectors provides custom nodes that centralize commonly shared parameters—such as scheduler, steps, config, and sampler—and allow you to link these settings to multiple nodes in your workflow. This eliminates redundancy and streamlines graph editing without breaking compatibility with ComfyUI’s JSON output format.
